# Ruining-The-World
A game where you're an hacker. It has a campaign, two minigames and a secret code challenge.

This game is still under development, the campaign isn't done yet, but all the other functions are ready for you to play!

-------------------------------------------------------------//--------------------------------------------------------------------

About the campaign, we're a team of two novice programmers and we're doing our best to create a good story for you guy's to play, the campaign isn't big but the challeges that you have to face will take a big part of your time.

About the minigames, we have made two minigames, one is about DDoS and the other is SQLinjection, we pretend to do more minigames in the future but for now our focus is on the main story.

-------------------------------------------------------------//--------------------------------------------------------------------

Try your luck on those two minigames where you have a chance of 0,0006% of winning, but don't worry your chance can get higher if you manage to make money, with that money you can upgrade you computer, and by doing that you will have an higher chance to win the minigames!

Have fun and good luck hackers!
