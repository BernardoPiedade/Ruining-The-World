    .Campaing

About the campaign, we're a team of two novice programmers and we're doing our best to create a good story for you guy's to play, the campaign isn't big but the challeges that you have to face will take a big part of your time.

About the minigames, we have made two minigames, one is about DDoS and the other is SQLinjection, we pretend to do more minigames in the future but for now our focus is on the main story.

    .Minigames

Try your luck on those three minigames where you have a chance of 0,0006% of winning, but don't worry your chance can get higher if you manage to make money, with that money you can upgrade you computer, and by doing that you will have an higher chance to win the minigames!

The three minigames are:

    1-> DDoS Game (You have to DDoS a website or a server)
    2-> SQLinjection Game (You have to try SQLinjection on a website)
    3-> Decrypting Game (You have to decrypt some files of a company)


Inside the minigames you have four more options, that is:

    1-> Work (Where you can work for others to make extra and easy money)
    2-> Bitcoin Mining (Where you can get your claims from your Bitcoin Miner)
    3-> ATM (Where you can send you money to credit card, you credit card money to your money, bitcoin to credit card or money)
    4-> My Stats (Where you can upgrade your computer, see your level, change your name and your pc name, see you rank, etc...)

Have fun and good luck hackers!
